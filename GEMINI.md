# Gemini Project Workflow

## Git Commits

To ensure consistent and well-formatted commit messages, please follow this workflow:

1.  Create a file named `commit_message.txt` in the project root.
2.  Write the commit message in this file, following the conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: Add new feature`).
3.  Run `git commit -F commit_message.txt` to create the commit.
4.  Delete the `commit_message.txt` file.
